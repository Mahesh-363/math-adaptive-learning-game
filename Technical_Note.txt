Technical Note – Adaptive Math Learning Game
--------------------------------------------

Overview
This project is a small adaptive learning prototype designed for children aged 5–10. 
The goal is to create a math practice game that automatically adjusts its difficulty 
based on how well the learner is performing. The system focuses on clean logic, 
simple architecture, and modular Python design rather than UI.

The project includes three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) and uses a 
rule-based adaptive engine to move the learner up or down based on correctness 
and response time.

----------------------------------------------------

Architecture / Flow Explanation
The project follows a modular structure, splitting responsibilities across 
separate Python files:

1. main.py  
   - Entry point of the game  
   - Runs the question loop, collects input, prints feedback  
   - Coordinates puzzle generation, tracking, and difficulty decisions

2. puzzle_generator.py  
   - Creates questions for each difficulty level  
   - Easy: single-digit addition/subtraction  
   - Medium: two-digit operations and simple multiplication  
   - Hard: larger sums, multiplication, and integer division  
   - Returns both the question and the correct answer

3. tracker.py  
   - Logs every attempt (question, answer, time taken, whether correct)  
   - Calculates accuracy and average response time  
   - Provides the most recent attempts for adaptation logic

4. adaptive_engine.py  
   - Contains the rule-based logic  
   - Uses the last three attempts to decide whether to increase, decrease, 
     or maintain the difficulty level  
   - Factors considered:
       • number of correct answers  
       • average response time  
       • current difficulty thresholds  

----------------------------------------------------

Adaptive Logic (Rule-Based)
The system checks the last 3 attempts:

• If 2 or more answers are correct AND the learner answers faster than the 
  threshold for that level → increase difficulty.  

• If 0 or 1 answer is correct → decrease difficulty.  

• Otherwise → keep the same level.

Time thresholds (tuned manually):
- easy: 8 seconds  
- medium: 12 seconds  
- hard: 20 seconds  

This creates a smooth learning curve without jumping levels too quickly.

----------------------------------------------------

Metrics Tracked
Each attempt stores:
- Question text  
- Correct answer  
- User’s answer  
- Difficulty level  
- Time taken  
- Whether the answer was correct  

Final session summary includes:
- Total questions answered  
- Number of correct answers  
- Accuracy percentage  
- Average response time  

These metrics allow teachers or developers to understand how the learner 
performed and how the adaptive logic behaved.

----------------------------------------------------

Why Rule-Based?
A rule-based approach was chosen because:

• It is simple to understand and easy to explain  
• No real-world data is required  
• Perfect for a small prototype  
• The logic is visible, transparent, and predictable  
• Easy to test and tune manually  

This avoids the complexity of building and training a machine learning model, 
which was not necessary for the scope of this assignment.

----------------------------------------------------

How It Could Scale (Future Work)
If real usage data is collected over time, the system can later be upgraded to an 
ML-driven adaptive engine. The existing modular structure already supports this.

Possible extensions:
- Logistic regression or decision tree for predicting difficulty  
- Support for more subjects (grammar, vocabulary, science)  
- GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit  
- Adaptive hints or explanations  

----------------------------------------------------

Conclusion
The project demonstrates how adaptive learning can be implemented in a simple but 
structured way. The modular architecture keeps the code clean and readable, and 
the rule-based logic makes the behaviour easy to understand and justify during 
evaluation. Even though the prototype is lightweight, it reflects the core idea 
behind modern personalized learning systems.
